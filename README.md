# H2O AutoML Example

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates how to use H2O's AutoML framework for automated machine learning model selection and evaluation. The code trains multiple machine learning models using the H2O AutoML library on the famous Iris dataset.

# Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following installed:

    Python (3.6 or later)
    H2O (installed via pip install h2o)
    A CSV file containing the Iris dataset (e.g., "iris.csv")

# Usage

  Install the required libraries using pip:

    pip install h2o
